Welcome to the **VisualFactory** - a creative arsenal of high-impact scripts crafted for **cinematic 3D visualization and molecular graphics**. Most of the algorithms are designed to operate within the internal Python environemnt of **ChimeraX**.

🔭 These tools leverage cutting-edge technologies to create data-informed representations of molecular word. 🧬

## 🚀 Features

🎞️ **Built for ChimeraX**  
  Scripts are optimized to oriduce high-quality rendering and data handling (e.g. operating with infinite number of molecular dynamics trajectories), using GUI or in batch (non-GUI).

🎲 **Harnessing the principles of Stochastisity**  
  Some scripts impmement a **"Casino-style"** approach, adding a unique flavor of controlled randomness to the parameters of main functions, **Adding a "bluff" boost**, injecting occasional visual variability for creative representation.

🤖 **Smart Feedback**  
  Most scripts offer **intuitive console outputs** and **support headless (in no-GUI mode with LINUX)** execution — great for automated pipelines and integration into your custom visual workflows.

🎥 **Multiple Visualization Modes**  
  Seamlessly transition between visualization modes — each unveiling deeper, distinct layers of molecular truth. 🔮

## 🐍 Example Use Case

No installation required: in most cases, simply drag and drop the script onto the ChimeraX GUI, or run it via the terminal with chimeraX for batch execution.
