Welcome to the **VisualFactory** - a creative arsenal of high-impact scripts crafted for **cinematic 3D visualization and molecular graphics**. Most of the algorithms are designed to operate within the internal Python environemnt of **ChimeraX**.

🔭 These tools leverage cutting-edge technologies to create data-informed representations of molecular word. 🧬

## 🚀 Features

🎞️ **Built for ChimeraX**  
  Scripts are optimized to oriduce high-quality rendering and data handling (e.g. operating with infinite number of molecular dynamics trajectories), using GUI or in batch (non-GUI).

🎲 **Harnessing the principles of Stochastisity**  
  Some scripts impmement a **"Casino-style"** approach, adding a unique flavor of controlled randomness to the parameters of main functions, **Adding a "bluff" boost**, injecting occasional visual variability for creative representation.

🤖 **Smart Feedback**  
  Most scripts offer **intuitive console outputs** and **support headless (in no-GUI mode with LINUX)** execution — great for automated pipelines and integration into your custom visual workflows.

🎞️ **Multiple Visualization Modes**  
  Seamlessly transition between visualization modes — each unveiling deeper, distinct layers of molecular truth. 🔮

## 🎥 Example Use Case

No installation required: in most cases, simply drag and drop the script onto the ChimeraX GUI, or run it via the terminal with chimeraX for batch execution. And prepare to unveil the things beneath the surface!
