# 🎨 VisualFactory

Welcome to the **VisualFactory** - a creative arsenal of high-impact scripts crafted for **cinematic 3D visualization and molecular graphics**. Most of the algorithms are designed to operate within the internal Python environemnt of **ChimeraX**.

🔭 These tools leverage cutting-edge visual technologies to create data-informed visualizations of molecular word. 🧬

## 🚀 Features

🎞️ **Built for ChimeraX**  
  Scripts are optimized to oriduce high-quality rendering and data handling (e.g. operating with infinite number of molecular dynamics trajectories), using GUI or in batch (non-GUI).

🎲 **Harnessing the principles of Stochastisity**  
  Some scripts impmement a **"Casino-style"** approach, adding a unique flavor of controlled randomness to the parameters of main functions, **Adding a "bluff" boost**, injecting occasional visual variability for creative representation.

🤖 **Smart Feedback**  
  Most scripts offer **intuitive console outputs** and **support headless (no-GUI)** execution — great for automated pipelines or server-based visual workflows.

🎥 **Multiple Visualization Modes**  
  Easily switch between **stochastic**, **fixed**, or **gradient-based** visualization strategies, adaptable for various experimental needs.

## 🔮 🐍 Example Use Case

In most cases you just need drag and drop the script on the GUI or run script with chimeraX in terminal (for batch execution)
