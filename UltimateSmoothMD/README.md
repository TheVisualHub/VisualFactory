**Version:** rev 4.00 alpha  
**Last updated:** 27 May 2025  

This script provides a suite of **FOUR** smoothing strategies to create visually coherent visualization of MD trajectories operating within the python intephace of **ChimeraX**. This tool is intended strictly for educational and personal purposes. The created smoothed coordinates are not suitable for commercial applications.
The current folder contains the latest (fourth) revision of the script. 🏆

## 🚀 MAIN FEATURES

**🧠 Four smoothing strategies:**

1️⃣ **Manual Smooth** – Take full control! Set your own smoothing window for each trajectory and fine-tune the motion exactly how you wish!

2️⃣ **Automatic Smooth** – Let it roll on its own: smooth factor = 2 × model ID. Want it softer or sharper? Just tweak the multiplier and go!

3️⃣ **Adaptive Smooth**: Window size scales according to the number of snapshots in the trajectories.

4️⃣ **Stochastic Smooth** (default): “Casino‑style” random window selection 🎲 This strategy introduces a "smart randomness" concept, inspired mainly by principles seen in casino games and poker decision-making, where small corrections (0 or +/- 1) are more likely, mimicking conservative choices in risk-based games. Occasionally, the algorithm introduces a small "bluff" or edge for models with mid-range IDs (like poker players pushing for unexpected moves), adding further variability to the smoothing factors.

  
- **Pluggable**: Apply to any number of loaded MD trajectories  
- **Real‑time feedback** via `session.logger.status`  
- **Modular** structure (`smooth_windows`, `smooth_models`, `run_smoothing`)
