**Version:** rev 4.00 alpha  
**Last updated:** 27 May 2025  

This script provides a suite of **FOUR** smoothing strategies to create visually coherent visualization of MD trajectories operating within the python intephace of **ChimeraX**. This tool is intended strictly for educational and personal purposes. The created smoothed coordinates are not suitable for commercial applications.
The current folder contains both the latest (fourth) and previous (third) revisions of the script — that has already powered numerous Hollywood-quality molecular films. 🏆

## 🚀 Features

- **Four smoothing strategies**  
  1. **Manual**: User‑defined windows per trajectory  
  2. **Automatic**: Window size = 2 × model ID  
  3. **Adaptive**: Window size scales with trajectory length  
  4. **Stochastic** (default): “Casino‑style” random window selection, inspired by casino. 🎲
- **Pluggable**: Apply to any number of loaded MD trajectories  
- **Real‑time feedback** via `session.logger.status`  
- **Modular** structure (`smooth_windows`, `smooth_models`, `run_smoothing`)
