This script provides a suite of **four** smoothing strategies to create visually coherent visualizations of MD trajectories using the Python interface of **ChimeraX**. This tool is intended strictly for educational and personal purposes. The generated smoothed coordinates are **not suitable for commercial applications**. The current folder contains the latest revision. 🏆

## 🛠️ Usage

### Option 1: 🖱️ Drag and Drop  
Simply drag and drop the script file (`UltimateSmoothMD4.py`) into the **ChimeraX GUI** window.  
### Option 2: 🏃‍♂️ Execute in ChimeraX via `run` command
`run UltimateSmoothMD4.py`

## 🚀 MAIN FEATURES

**🧠 Four smoothing strategies:**

1️⃣ **Manual Smooth** – Take full control! Set your own smoothing window for each trajectory and fine-tune the motion exactly how you wish!

2️⃣ **Automatic Smooth** – Let it roll on its own: smooth factor = 2 × model ID. Want it softer or sharper? Just tweak the multiplier and go!

3️⃣ **Adaptive Smooth**: Window size scales according to the number of snapshots in the trajectories.

4️⃣ **Stochastic Smooth** (default): “Casino‑style” random window selection 🎲 This strategy introduces a "smart randomness" concept, inspired mainly by principles seen in casino games and poker decision-making, where small corrections (0 or +/- 1) are more likely, mimicking conservative choices in risk-based games. Occasionally, the algorithm introduces a small "bluff" or edge for models with mid-range IDs (like poker players pushing for unexpected moves), adding further variability to the smoothing factors.

  
- **Pluggable**: Apply to any number of loaded MD trajectories  
- **Real‑time feedback** via `session.logger.status`  
- **Modular** structure (`smooth_windows`, `smooth_models`, `run_smoothing`)

## 🛠️ Requirements:

- **[ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/)** – Any recent version.
- **NumPy** – Required for RMSD calculations and numerical operations (already included with ChimeraX).
- Standard python libraries: `time`, `random`
